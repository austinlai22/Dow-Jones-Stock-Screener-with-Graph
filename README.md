# Dow-Jones-Stock-Screener-with-Graph
This code is for Python; it screens DJIA stocks using December 10, 2020 data based on P/E, Forward P/E, PEG, P/S, P/B, P/FCF, D/E, ROA, ROE, ROI, dividend yield, and performance YTD. The code also creates a graph to easily visualize data output, along with a sorted list.

The code still needs to be improved via web scraping from Yahoo Finance or Finviz if possible to update information effortlessly.
